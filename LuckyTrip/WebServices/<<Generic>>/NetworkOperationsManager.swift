/*
-----------------
Manaual
-----------------
Subclass this class to create Network Managers
- Network managers are used to hold functions of network operations such as login, signup, register, ... etc.
- Network manager also handles the response in both error and success cases
-----------------------------------------
implmentation structure of subclass
-----------------------------------------
   1. function header will take all the data that you need to pass with the request, and the handler functions references for error and success cases
   2. initiate the operation object and set its parameters
   3. define the response operation
   4. call the exeucteQueue function passing your operation as leading operation, and the response handler operation as dependend operation
